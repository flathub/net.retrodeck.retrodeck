## What is RetroDECK?
RetroDECK is a [EmulationStation Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org) powered application that builds in a variety of emulators and other software that allows you to play your favorite retro (and even not-so-retro) games in a tidy contained sandbox environment. It's inspired by embedded emulation systems like AmberELEC, EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera.

RetroDECK supports the following devices: 
<br/><br/>
**Steam Deck**
<br/>
**Linux Desktop** (after the BETA period)
<br/>
**Other SteamOS devices** (after the BETA period)

### RetroDECK is tailored to the Steam Deck during the BETA period.
The goal is that all the configurations are ready out-of-the-box and optimized towards the Steam Deck. Just put your `ROMS` & `BIOS` in the corresponding folders and start playing.

### How do I install RetroDECK?
Read and follow the guide here: [Installation instructions](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/How-to:-Getting-started) on the Wiki

# Short FAQ

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki) for even more information.

## Do I have to partition or format my disk/sdcard to install it?
No, partitioning or formatting is not needed at all. RetroDECK (differently from AmberELEC, Batocera and others) comes as a flatpak. Just install it as any other application and launch it from your desktop and/or Steam library. 

## Do you support Windows?
No, RetroDECK doesn't support Windows, but the project is fully open source so you can port it if you wish. 
As an alternative you could try [Retrobat](https://www.retrobat.org/) that offers similar functionality.

## Do you support the Linux Desktop?
We do plan to support Linux Desktop in the future. But during the BETA we are focusing on the Steam Deck. Technically it is working, but the user experience might not be that great (it could contain desktop specific bugs and other issues). If you want to try it make sure that your distribution has native flatpak support else, you might need to install it.

## Do you support other SteamOS based devices?
We do plan to support other SteamOS based devices in the future. But during the BETA we are focusing on the Steam Deck.
You can still run it but you might need to do some configurations by yourself.
