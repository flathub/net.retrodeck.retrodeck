# What is RetroDECK?
Instead of having several different software on your system for a variety of emulators and frontends you only need to have one: RetroDECK.

RetroDECK is a [EmulationStation Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org) (ES-DE) powered flatpak application that builds in a variety of emulators and other software that allows you to play your favorite retro (and even not-so-retro) games in one complete package. 

It's inspired by embedded emulation systems like:

- AmberELEC
- EmuELEC
- CoreELEC
- Lakka
- Batocera

The RetroDECK team consists of several veterans from some of the projects mentioned above as well as a bunch of other talented individuals.

RetroDECK also adds the `RetroDECK Framework` and the `RetroDECK Configurator` on top of the emulators and ES-DE frontend that allows deeper integrations between emulators and easier exposure to a variety of features that you otherwise need to set per emulator basis to create a uniformity between them.
